# Quickstart

## Installation

see·el·aye has a peer dependency on [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org). Make sure to
install and configure Vuex before proceeding. Since see·el·aye only works with
Vue 3, you will need version 4 of Vuex.

see·el·aye is served from the npm registry as
[`seeelaye`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/seeelaye).

```
npm install --save seeelaye
```

see·el·aye is written in and completely supports TypeScript. Type definitions
are included in the package.

## Setup

Add the Vuex module for see·el·aye in your store. You can use any name for the
module (`'terminal'` in this case). You can also use register and unregister
the module dynamically if you are so inclined.

```js
// @/store/index.js
import { createStore } from 'vuex'
import { getVuexModule } from 'seeelaye'

const store = createStore({
  modules: {
    terminal: getVuexModule(), // remember the name you use here
  },
})

export default store
```

see·el·aye needs some configuration, it absolutely does **not** work out of the
box. Create a new directory `terminal/` in your `src/` directory with an index
file in it.

```
mkdir src/terminal/
touch src/terminal/index.js
```

This is the file where see·el·aye's functionality can be tweaked. Pass your Vuex
store and see·el·aye's module name as the first two arguments to the `Seeelaye`
constructor. Optionally, you can
- deactivate [built-in binaries](?path=/docs/bins-callable--hello) by passing a list of commands to turn off as the 3<sup>rd</sup> argument
- define [custom binaries](?path=/docs/guide-custom-binaries--page) and register them as the 4<sup>th</sup> argument

```js
// @/terminal/index.js
import { Seeelaye } from 'seeelaye'

import store from '@/store'

const seeelaye = new Seeelaye({
  store,      // the application's Vuex store
  'terminal', // the name of the store module from the previous step
  ['hello'],  // the built-in binaries to exclude (optional)
  {},         // additional custom binaries to include (optional)
})

export default seeelaye
```

see·el·aye should be installed like a Vue plugin. In your `main.js` file, you
should install see·el·aye using the `.use` API.

```js
import { createApp } from 'vue'

import store from '@/store'
import seeelaye from '@/terminal'

import App from '@/App.vue'

const app = createApp(App)

app
  .use(store)    // this should come before see·el·aye
  .use(seeelaye) // this should come after the store

app.mount('#app')
```

## Render

In the component where you'd like to show a terminal, place the `Terminal`
component. Note that it is not automatically registered globally.

By default, the terminal will not have any associated styles. You can
[apply a theme](?path=/docs/containers-terminal--solarized-dark#theming) of your
choice by setting the `class` attribute. If you prefer a
[custom theme](?path=/docs/guide-custom-themes--page) just change the class.

You will need to include the corresponding theme stylesheet.

```html
<template>
  <Terminal class="solarized dark"/>
</template>

<script>
  import { Terminal } from 'seeelaye'

  export default {
    components: { Terminal },
  }
</script>

<style lang="css" src="seeelaye/style/style.css"></style>
<style scoped lang="css" src="seeelaye/themes/solarized.css"></style>
<style scoped lang="css">
  ::v-deep(.terminal) {
    /* all CSS custom properties for customization */
  }
</style>
```
