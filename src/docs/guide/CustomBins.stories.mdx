see·el·aye ships with a bunch of built-in binaries. A comprehensive list of
pre-baked binaries can be found in the
[docs](?path=/docs/bins-callable--hello#callable-binaries).

While these cover many operations, it is not exhaustive. see·el·aye allows you
to define your own and inject them into the terminal. A good place to define the
components is in a `bin/` directory inside the `src/terminal` directory that
contains the see·el·aye configuration.

## Guide

A component is just a Vue component that conforms to certain specifications
that make it invokable from the CLI engine. Here are the requirements to define
a custom binary. When defining binaries as SFCs, the file must export the
following two items.

- a function that returns a `Binary` instance, conventionally named `binaryFn`
- a Vue component as its default export

### Binary and arguments

The exported `binaryFn` provides the metadata that see·el·aye needs to map input
commands to binaries and their arguments.

1. Create the arguments for the binary. You can skip this step if your binary
is not supposed to take any arguments. Arguments must be functions that return
either an `Arg` or `NodeArg` instance. `NodeArgs` are subclassed from
`Arg<string>`.

2. Define your `binaryFn`. The `Binary` class accepts two arrays of types as
generics.

**E.g.,** a binary with no positional arguments and no keyword arguments. In such
cases, pass two empty arrays as generics for `Binary`.
```ts
import { Binary } from 'seeelaye'

export const binaryFn = (): Binary<[], []> => new Binary<[], []>(
  'Intro',
  'intro',
  'Show my handle as ASCII art.',
  [], // no positional arguments
  [], // no keyword arguments
)
```

**E.g.,** a binary with a node path as the positional argument and no keyword
arguments. A `NodeArg` maps to a `string` as the generic for `Binary`.
```ts
import { ArgType, NodeArg } from 'seelaye'
import { Binary } from 'seeelaye'
import { FsNodeType} from 'seeelaye'

const dirpathFn = () => new NodeArg(
  ArgType.POSITIONAL,
  'dirpath',
  'the path or name of the directory to switch to',
  FsNodeType.FOLDER,
  '~',
)
export const binaryFn = (): Binary<[string], []> => {
  const dirpath = dirpathFn()
  return new Binary<[string], []>(
    'ChangeDir',
    'cd',
    'Switch to the given directory as the working directory.',
    [dirpath],
    [],
  )
}
```

**E.g.,** a binary with a flag (boolean) as the keyword argument and no
positional arguments. The generic for `Arg` should also be passed to `Binary`.
```ts
import { ArgType, Arg } from 'seelaye'
import { Binary } from 'seeelaye'

const grootFn = () => new Arg<boolean>(
  ArgType.KEYWORD,
  'groot',
  'whether to run command as Groot',
  Boolean,
  false,
  ['g'],
)
export const binaryFn = (): Binary<[], [boolean]> => {
  const groot = grootFn()
  return new Binary<[], [boolean]>(
    'WhoAmI',
    'whoami',
    'Display the name of the current active user.',
    [],
    [groot],
  )
}
```
